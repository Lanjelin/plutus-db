# Database FAQ

This database is a collection of text files containing all funded P2PKH Bitcoin addresses downloaded from http://addresses.loyce.club/  
Plutus only works with P2PKH Bitcoin addresses, so the rest was stripped from the original database

This database was last updated April 29, 2023

### How Many Addresses Does The Database Have?

This database currently holds `22,536,575 P2PKH Bitcoin addresses`. This is the total number of P2PKH Bitcoin addresses with a balance that exist in the blockchain at the time of uploading.

### Why Are There So Many Files?

There are multiple files because GitHub limits file uploads to 50 MB. The single file is too large, so it was split into multiple files each under 50 MB in order to be uploaded to GitHub.
